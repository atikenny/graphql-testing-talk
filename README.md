### Elevator pitch (~300 characters)

Building systems using microservices is hard. In most cases the owners of the services know very little about how they are consumed and if their users are successful. It gets even more complicated when you introduce changes and want to deprecate things. Consumer driven testing allows you to describe contracts between consumers and providers that you can validate while developing so you can make sure you are not breaking things.
